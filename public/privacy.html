<body>
        <p>HUGE BELIEVE has great experience in Facebook application and fan pages development. Facebook's policies require that your app has a privacy policy that tells users what user data you are going to use and how you will use, display, share, or transfer that data and you will include your privacy policy URL in the Developer Application (See Platform Policy II.3, http://developers.facebook.com/policy). If you do not provide privacy policy with your Facebook application, the application could be removed. Below you can find example of Facebook application privacy policy that we use in our FB applications. You are free to copy it from below or download the template HERE ((just replace HUGE BELIEVE with your company name and [COMPANY-EMAIL] with your company email).</p>
        <p>Application Privacy Statement</p>
        <p>This privacy statement (&ldquo;Privacy Statement&rdquo;) applies to the treatment of personally identifiable information submitted by, or otherwise obtained from, you in connection with the associated application (&ldquo;Application&rdquo;). The Application is provided by HUGE BELIEVE (and may be provided by HUGE BELIEVE on behalf of a HUGE BELIEVE licensor or partner (&ldquo;Application Partner&rdquo;). By using or otherwise accessing the Application, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Statement.</p>

The types of personal information collected may include your full name, email address, gender, IP address, browser information, username, demographic information, and any other information necessary for us to provide the Application services.</p>
        <p>Personal Information Collected Automatically:<br />We receive and store certain types of usage related information whenever you interact with Application.
